# SebastAIn
Named after Sebastian of Stardew Valley, SebastAIn is a Python based AI Chatbot meant to receive and output speech, along with providing a visual avatar. No APIs are used, and therefore this project is entirely free to use. The user only needs a personal LLM model runnable via Ollama in order to use this project.

The personal goal of this project is to create an interactable chatbot to use for twitch streaming, learn about Python AI support, and investigate useful libraries available. 

## Design
 Using Ollama to interact with a locally running LLM, the user can specify the Ollama model file to use, along with choosing a specific Piper Voice for speech output. 
The entire process is offline using locally hosted models and software.
The below diagram specifies current features alrady implemented:
